# Inception Bot
Inception bot is a chess engine built using lichess-bot. Play it here at [Inception Bot](https://lichess.org/@/inception-bot).

It is a neural network-based engine built on the [Inception architecture](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.4842) with a few tweaks. It doesn't use max pool layers and adds squeeze exitation layers after the convolutions. To find moves, it uses Monte Carlo Tree Search.

Inception bot is at about the intermediate level (~1600 ELO). It struggles with speed and therefore cannot search deep into the game. One notable bug with the engine is that it often stalemates, repeating moves in a winning position. 

## Overview

[lichess-bot](https://github.com/lichess-bot-devs/lichess-bot) is a free bridge
between the [Lichess Bot API](https://lichess.org/api#tag/Bot) and chess engines.

With lichess-bot, you can create and operate a bot on lichess. Your bot will be able to play against humans and bots alike, and you will be able to view these games live on lichess.

See also the lichess-bot [documentation](https://github.com/lichess-bot-devs/lichess-bot/wiki) for further usage help.
